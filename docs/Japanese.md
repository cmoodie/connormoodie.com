# Japanese

Learning Japanese inspired by [Morg Systems](https://morg.systems/58465ab9) (this page is also where I got the inspiration for the structure of my own website). I've followed the general structure set out there, however have branched off into my own way of learning as I've found what works best for me.

I have kept the general structure of splitting learning into 3 categories:

* [[Vocab]]
* Grammar
* [[Listening]]#
