See [here](https://vite.dev/guide/why.html) for a good explanation of what Vite is and what it does. In summary:
* Vite gives a dev server that allows for instant updating on changes while preserving state.
* Vite "bundles" all of your modularised code into a format a browser can handle, which can then be use by the web server.
