I've been slowly amassing a collection of board games, and through playing them I have a rough idea of where they all stand in my own subjective ranking. But I've realised that actually ranking them against each other is a fruitless task, as two different games often fill two completely different purposes in my collection. How can you possibly directly compare [Dune Imperium](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/316554/dune-imperium) and [Wandering Towers](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/355483/wandering-towers) for example?

## Enjoyability & Accessibility
These are the two cores that I will use to judge a board game. To clarify, I'm not judging on their levels of enjoyability or accessibility, I'm determining *what kind of* enjoyment and accessibility they provide, and explaining *how they provide it*.

One thing to note is that accessibility is often not a factor for people who play a lot of board games. But unless you only plan on playing board games with similarly minded people, accessibility turns out to be a huge factor in how often that board game comes off that shelf.

## Kinds of Enjoyability
A game can have multiple kinds of enjoyability, but they usually have one main one. I've separated the games into different pages according to their main kind of enjoyability.

## Kinds of Accessibility
Accessibilty categories come it pairs - while sometimes one category in the pair is clearly the "negative" one, this is not always the case. Falling in the middle would give no accessibility category.

**Cooperative / Competitive**<br>
Self explanatory from the title. Note that cooperative games often have low downtime.

**Short / Long**<br>
A short game I'd define as one that can play in under 30 minutes; a long game in over 1.5 hours.

**Short Teach / Long Teach**<br>
A short teach I'd define as one that lasts under 2 minutes, a long teach lasts over 10 minutes.

**Low Downtime / High Downtime**<br>
Low downtime means you're always doing something in the game. This may be because turns come round very often, or because in between turns there's always something to think about. This results in a very engaging game that does not leave much room for boredom or other discussion.

High downtime means you're often not doing anything in the game. Turns come round infrequently and in between turns there's not too much to think about. This results in an "in the background" game that can get boring but also can leave room for discussion on other things.

I personally hate high downtime games, but I understand that some people want to just sit around Wingspan for 4 hours discussing life.

**Forgiving / Punishing**<br>
A forgiving game does not punish you too hard for not playing the best move. It allows for turns where you just make a simple move because your brain is rebooting and you'll think next turn, and it lets less experienced players not immediately lose.

A punishing game rewards skill and concentration in the game by punishing those without.

**RNG Light / RNG Heavy**<br>
An RNG Light game is one that relies more on the skill of the players *and the decisions of the players* to determine the game. Note that these games can still feel "random" when your fellow players do not do what you expect them to.

An RNG Heavy game is one that includes a large amount of luck in the game. Luck is usually the deciding factor in who wins (not at all always a bad thing).
