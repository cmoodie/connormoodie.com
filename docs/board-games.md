I've been slowly amassing a collection of board games, and through playing them I have a rough idea of where they all stand in my own subjective ranking. But I've realised that actually ranking them against each other is a fruitless task, as two different games often fill two completely different purposes in my collection. How can you possibly directly compare [Dune Imperium](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/316554/dune-imperium) and [Wandering Towers](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/355483/wandering-towers) for example?

Instead, I've decided to try come up with different categories of board games, each with their own ideal 'profile'. For example, a short luck-based game may be great, and a long thinky game may also be great, while short thinky games and long luck-based games don't really work.

## Properties
To achieve this, we first need to define the different properties that a game can be defined by. These properties will be defined by the opposition of two characteristics a game can have, where each game generally lies somewhere in between. No strict values are given to this properties, when using them it's more of a qualitative score.

**Simple -- Complex**<br>
Simple games have a small decision space and a lower skill ceiling; complex games have a large decision space and high skill ceiling.

**Short -- Long**<br>
Short games can be as quick as 5 minutes; long games can take up to 6 hours or so. Time taken by legacy games is considered as how long each session is. Also takes into account how long a game *feels*, where games that have you waiting for your turn being docked points too.

**Luck-based -- Skill-based**<br>
Luck-based games rely heavily on luck to determine outcomes; skill-based games rely on player skill.

**Instinctual -- Calculating**<br>
Instinctual games encourage players to 'go with their gut'; calculating games encourage calculation to find the best continuation.

**Forgiving -- Punishing**<br>
Forgiving games allow the player to come back from mistakes without requiring mistakes from other players by ensuring no possible mistake is too large; punishing games do not.

**Solitary -- Interactive**<br>
Solitary games have players not be affected by other players' actions; interactive games do.

**Nice -- Mean**<br>
Nice games have players positively interact with each other, such as giving each other bonuses; mean games have players negatively interact with each other, such as stealing from them.

**Abstract -- Thematic**<br>
Abstract games lack a theme that complements the mechanics; thematic games have theme and are often centred around said theme.

**Funny -- Serious**<br>
Funny games often make people laugh; serious games do not.

**Chill -- Stressful**<br>
Chill games feel relaxing to play with no time pressure whatsoever; stressful games give players stress, for example from time limits or difficult situations.

## Categories
Next is to define the different categories board games can fall into, and the ideal values for the properties for a game in said category. A category has a weight (W) given to each property to indicate how important it is for games in that category - there are 10 properties and so all weights must add to 10. For a game in a category, each property gets a score out of 10, thus the final score for a game is out of 100, or divided by 10 to be a score out of 10.

How each property is scored relative to the 'ideal' value of the property is not exact and fairly subjective. The score for each property shouldn't just be based on how close it is to the 'ideal' value, but also how well that property of the game makes the game enjoyable within its category. For example, a brain-burner may be adequately complicated, but if its complexity is not interesting and instead just painful, then it would get a poor score for that property.

Also note that a property may be missing from a game category - this implies that that property has a weight of 0 for that category.

Each section contains a link to a list of my games that fit that category. Note that sometimes a game may fit under multiple categories, but are only included in their highest scoring category.

**Party Game**<br>
These are games that you could introduce and teach to literally anybody, generally should have a high/variable player count, and don't last too long as people come and go.
* *Simple -- Complex* (W = 4): As simple as possible.
* *Short -- Long* (W = 2): As short as possible.
* *Luck-based -- Skill-based* (W = 2): Quite luck based, but still with some skill involved to ensure players feel that they have agency.
* *Instinctual -- Calculating* (W = 1): Should be fairly instinctual to ensure turns go quickly and players don't feel 'too dumb' for the game.
* *Funny -- Serious* (W = 1): Should be as funny as possible

See my list [[party-games|here]].<br><br>

**Filler Game**<br>
These are games that are super quick little games to whip out when you don't have too much time and want to start up or round out a night. Or sometimes you just have a night of filler games, like skipping the main course and instead just having a bunch of snacks.
* *Simple -- Complex* (W = 3): Simple enough to explain to board gamers in under 10 minutes.
* *Short -- Long* (W = 3): Fairly short, but still long enough to feel that one game is enough.
* *Chill -- Stressful* (W = 2): Should be very chill, don't want to stress out over a filler game.
* *Forgiving -- Punishing* (W = 1): Should be reasonably forgiving, you may be out of contention for winning quickly but you should at least be able to play the game to the end.
* *Instinctual -- Calculating* (W = 1): Should be fairly instinctual to ensure turns go quickly.

See my list [[filler-games|here]].<br><br>

**Lightweight Game**<br>
These are games perfect for either new players, or players that just want a simple bit of good fun.
* *Simple -- Complex* (W = 2): More complex than a party game to make it interesting, but not too intimidating.
* *Luck-based -- Skill-based* (W = 2): Enough luck to give newer players a chance at winning, while still giving agency.
* *Forgiving -- Punishing* (W = 2): Very forgiving, no play a player may make should be really bad, the skills should come in identifying the best in a sea of good.
* *Chill -- Stressful* (W = 2): Should be chill, although some stressful decisions here and there won't hurt.
* *Abstract -- Thematic* (W = 2): Should be fairly thematic to keep new players interested.

**Brain-burner**<br>
These are games made to make your brain hurt, but then feel elated when you figure things out throughout it.
* *Simple -- Complex* (W = 3): Should be complex in an interesting way.
* *Instinctual -- Calculating* (W = 3): Should be calculating and reward calculation.
* *Luck-based -- Skill-based* (W = 3): Should be mainly skill-based to not constantly give bad results to well-calculated plays.
* *Solitary -- Interactive* (W = 1): Should be solitary enough to allow for calculation while other players are taking their turn.

See my list [[brain-burners|here]].<br><br>

**Brawler**<br>
These are games that pit players against each other, where stopping other people winning is as important as you yourself winning.
* *Solitary -- Interactive* (W = 4): Should be highly interactive.
* *Luck-based -- Skill-based* (W = 2): Should be skill-based enough to not make the game feel too unfair to players, but luck-based enough to allow players to blame the game a little bit.
* *Nice -- Mean* (W = 2): Should be a little on the mean side, you are brawling after all.
* *Funny -- Serious* (W = 2): Should be generally funny to help alleviate the tension caused from all the brawling.

**Test of Wits**<br>
These are games that purely test skill, and is the only category that breaks my general rule of 'losing must be fun too'. As such, I don't often enjoy these types of games.
* *Simple -- Complex* (W = 5): Must be complex enough to allow wits to be tested.
* *Luck-based -- Skill-based* (W = 5): Purely skill-based, no blaming the game here.

**Builder**<br>
These are games that let you build towards something, whether that be an actual building or town, or just a series of achievements.
* *Chill -- Stressful* (W = 4): Should be very chill, happily building up your whatever.
* *Nice -- Mean* (W = 3): Interactivity in these games is fine, but any interaction must be nice suprising benefits for the players. No 'take that's.
* *Forgiving -- Punishing* (W = 2): Should be fairly forgiving, want the players to always be able to build something, not necessarily what they wanted but still something.
* *Abstract -- Thematic* (W = 1): Should be very thematic to allow players to care about what they're building.

**Adrenaline Rush**<br>
These are games that make you internally go "AAAAHHHHHHHHH" throughout them. Generally including restrictions on either time, communication, or telling the truth
* *Chill -- Stressful* (W = 4): Should be quite stressful, and really get your heart going!
* *Forgiving -- Punishing* (W = 3): Should be quite punishing, need to set the stakes high!
* *Abstract -- Thematic* (W = 2): Should be quite thematic, setting a theme to aid in the adrenaline rush.
* *Short -- Long* (W = 1): Fairly short, don't want to be stressed out for too long.

**Chaos**<br>
This is the [Galaxy Trucker](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/31481/galaxy-trucker) category, where you just want chaos to unfold and see what happens.
* *Funny -- Serious* (W = 3): Should be very funny, pretty much the point of the game.
* *Luck-based -- Skill-based* (W = 3): Pretty much entirely luck-based, so you just feel unlucky when things go wrong as opposed to annoyed at yourself.
* *Short -- Long* (W = 2): Fairly short, want to be able to reset often.
* *Forgiving -- Punishing* (W = 2): Should be quite punishing, more funny when things go wrong for them to go REALLY wrong.
