# Board Games

I've been slowly amassing a collection of board games, and through playing them I have a rough idea of where they all stand in my own subjective ranking. But I've realised that actually ranking them against each other is a fruitless task, as two different games often fill two completely different purposes in my collection. How can you possibly directly compare [Dune Imperium](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/316554/dune-imperium) and [Wandering Towers](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/355483/wandering-towers) for example?

Instead, I've decided to try come up with different categories of board games, each with their own ideal 'profile'. For example, a short luck-based game may be great, and a long thinky game may also be great, while short thinky games and long luck-based games don't really work.

## Properties
To achieve this, we first need to define the different properties that a game can be defined by. These properties will be defined by the opposition of two characteristics a game can have, where each game generally lies somewhere in between. No strict values are given to this properties, when using them it's more of a qualitative score.

**Simple -- Complex**<br>
Simple games have a small decision space and a lower skill ceiling; complex games have a large decision space and high skill ceiling.

**Short -- Long**<br>
Short games can be as quick as 5 minutes; long games can take up to 6 hours or so. Time taken by legacy games is considered as how long each session is.

**Luck-based -- Skill-based**<br>
Luck-based games rely heavily on luck to determine outcomes; skill-based games rely on player skill.

**Instinctual -- Calculating**<br>
Instinctual games encourage players to 'go with their gut'; calculating games encourage calculation to find the best continuation.

**Forgiving -- Punishing**<br>
Forgiving games allow the player to come back from mistakes without requiring mistakes from other players; punishing games do not.

**Solitary -- Interactive**<br>
Solitary games have players not be affected by other players' actions; interactive games do.

**Nice -- Mean**<br>
Nice games have players positively interact with each other, such as giving each other bonuses; mean games have players negatively interact with each other, such as stealing from them.

**Abstract -- Thematic**<br>
Abstract games lack a theme that complements the mechanics; thematic games have theme and are often centred around said theme.

**Funny -- Serious**<br>
Funny games often make people laugh; serious games do not.

**Chill -- Stressful**<br>
Chill games feel relaxing to play with no time pressure whatsoever; stressful games give players stress, for example from time limits or difficult situations.

## Categories
Next is to define the different categories board games can fall into, and the ideal values for the properties for a game in said category. A category has a weight (W) given to each property to indicate how important it is for games in that category - there are 10 properties and so all weights must add to 10. For a game in a category, each property gets a score out of 10, thus the final score for a game is out of 100.

How each property is scored relative to the 'ideal' value of the property is not exact and fairly subjective. The score for each property shouldn't just be based on how close it is to the 'ideal' value, but also how well that property of the game makes the game enjoyable within its category.

Finally, note that a property may be missing from a game category - this implies that that property has a weight of 0 for that category.

**Party game**<br>
These are games that you could introduce and teach to literally anybody, generally should have a high/variable player count, and don't last too long as people come and go.
* *Simple -- Complex* (W = 4): As simple as possible.
* *Short -- Long* (W = 2): As short as possible.
* *Luck-based -- Skill-based (W = 2): Quite luck based, but still with some skill involved to ensure players feel that they have agency.
* *Instinctual -- Calculating (W = 1): Should be fairly instinctual to ensure turns go quickly and players don't feel 'too dumb' for the game.
* *Funny -- Serious (W = 1): Should be as funny as possible

**Filler Game**<br>

**Entry-level game**<br>

**Brain-burner**<br>

**Brawler**<br>

**Builder**<br>
