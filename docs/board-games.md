I've been slowly amassing a collection of board games, and through playing them I have a rough idea of where they all stand in my own subjective ranking. But I've realised that actually ranking them against each other is a fruitless task, as two different games often fill two completely different purposes in my collection. How can you possibly directly compare [Dune Imperium](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/316554/dune-imperium) and [Wandering Towers](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/355483/wandering-towers) for example?

## Situations
I've found that the board games I pull out the most are those that fit specific *situations* very well. So for rating my board games, I'll rate them based on some general situations. If a board game is not rated for a situation, then I'm claiming it isn't suited for that situation. Otherwise, there are three ratings:
* **BEST:** A go-to choice for the situation, always a winner so great for new groups.
* **GOOD:** A solid choice for the situation for groups that I've played things with before, can be a nice change up.
* **FINE:** It's... fine. Suits the situation well enough -- this ranking is usually accompanied with a specific condition under which it is a higher ranking.

A board game can fit multiple situations and will get an individual rating for each they fit. Below are the situations:

**Party**<br>
A situation with a lot of people, most of who probably don't know what a board game is. Requires a game with a high player count, short teach, and simple play.

**Waiting**<br>
A situation where people are having to wait for an unspecified amount of time. Requires a game that can be satisfactorily stopped at any point even if the game isn't technically over. Short teach ideal, but not necessary if everyone already knows how to play.

**Get-together**<br>
A situation with a few friends, where the primary purpose of the night isn't to play board games. Requires a game with broad appeal without a long teach.

**Family Get-together**<br>
A situation with family and those generally without the time or patience for board games. Requires a game with a short teach and short playtime but unlike party games works well with low player counts.

**Game Night**<br>
A situation with some regular friends for a game night. Requires a game interesting enough to warrant repeat plays on future game nights.

**Solo**<br>
A situation with just yourself and you're really feeling like playing a board game.

## Tags
The board games will also be tagged with some pre-defined tags to give a rough idea on how the game plays. The tags are below:

* **X-Y Players:** The player count - all games will have this tag.
* **X hours/minutes:** The time to play one game - all games will have this tag.
* **Cooperative:** The game is cooperative - all players win or lose together.
* **Short/Long Teach:** The teach is shorter/longer than normal.
* **Short/Long/Simultaneous Turns:** The turns are shorter/longer than normal, specifically time between turns (unless Simultaneous).
* **Forgiving/Punishing:** The game is more forgiving/punishing of mistakes than normal.
* **Abstract/Thematic:** The game is more abstract/thematic than normal.
* **Multiplayer Solitaire:** The game has very little to no player interaction.
* **Story:** The game places great importance on its story and writing.
* **Brain Burner:** The game will hurt your brain.
* **Builder:** This game will have you "build" something you're proud of win or lose.
* **Dexterity:** This game is a dexterity game (think [Jenga](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2452/jenga)).
* **Social Deduction:** This game is a social deduction game (think [Werewolf](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/925/werewolf))
* **RNG Bullshit:** The game is basically just pure RNG and you're experiencing it.
* **Stress:** The game may stress you out, usually due to involving a timer.

Here's my ratings of the brain-burners I've played based on the system set out #[[board-games|here]]. Reminder of the ideal property values below:

* *Simple -- Complex* (W = 3): Should be complex in an interesting way.
* *Instinctual -- Calculating* (W = 3): Should be calculating and reward calculation.
* *Luck-based -- Skill-based* (W = 3): Should be mainly skill-based to not constantly give bad results to well-calculated plays.
* *Solitary -- Interactive* (W = 1): Should be solitary enough to allow for calculation while other players are taking their turn.

## Owned
**The Search for Planet X** ([BGG](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/279537/search-planet-x))<br>
A massive logic puzzle that everyone seems to enjoy, even those not into logic puzzles usually.
* *Simple -- Complex*: **7/10**
  * A good puzzle, but gameplay can get stale after a few plays.
* *Instinctual -- Calculating*: **10/10**
  * This game is pure calculation, and rewards it well.
* *Luck-based -- Skill-based*: **9/10**
  * Pretty much entirely skill based, but can be a little luck based with lucky surveys or targets.
* *Solitary -- Interactive*: **10/10**
  * If you want you can treat it as a solo game, but can always choose to incorporate others' actions.

Final score: **8.8/10**<br><br>

**The Search for Lost Species** ([BGG](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/279537/search-planet-x))<br>
An even more complex massive logic puzzle that players of Planet X enjoy even more.
* *Simple -- Complex*: **10/10**
  * Incredible puzzle, although disclaimer I've only played it once.
* *Instinctual -- Calculating*: **10/10**
  * This game is pure calculation, and rewards it well.
* *Luck-based -- Skill-based*: **9/10**
  * Pretty much entirely skill based, but can be a little luck based with lucky surveys or targets.

**Brass Birmingham** ([BGG](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/224517/brass-birmingham))<br>
Number 1 on BGG for a reason.
* *Simple -- Complex*: **10/10**
  * I will never fully understand this game but I will constantly enjoy trying to.
* *Instinctual -- Calculating*: **10/10**
  * So much long-term planning in this game, but all of it is fun.
* *Luck-based -- Skill-based*: **10/10**
  * I suppose there's slight luck by what other people do and the cards you draw, but that just makes the calculations more interesting and its still a 10 here for me.
* *Solitary -- Interactive*: **8/10**
  * Can sometimes have turns take a while due to changing circumstances, but usually you can know roughly what your plan for your next turn is before it comes around.

Final score: **9.8/10**<br><br>

**The Crew: The Quest for Planet Nine** ([BGG](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/284083/crew-quest-planet-nine))<br>
Making you and your team feel amazingly smart when you succeed.
* *Simple -- Complex*: **8/10**
  * Such complexity arising from such simple rules it's fantastic, although can be a little too simple occasionally.
* *Instinctual -- Calculating*: **8/10**
  * Counting cards makes this game really interesting, but sometimes you just have to go with your gut.
* *Luck-based -- Skill-based*: **8/10**
  * Sometimes you get a dud round where you either easily win or lose, but usually you win or lose based on the skill of your team.
* *Solitary -- Interactive*: **10/10**
  * As a cooperative game, what your teammates do *is* the puzzle.

Final score: **8.2/10**<br><br>

**The Crew: Mission Deep Sea** ([BGG](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/324856/crew-mission-deep-sea))<br>
