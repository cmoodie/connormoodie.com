---

Here's my ratings of the filler games I've played based on the system set out #[[board-games|here]]. Reminder of the ideal property values below:

* *Simple -- Complex* (W = 3): Simple enough to explain to board gamers in under 10 minutes.
* *Short -- Long* (W = 3): Fairly short, but still long enough to feel that one game is enough.
* *Chill -- Stressful* (W = 2): Should be very chill, don't want to stress out over a filler game.
* *Forgiving -- Punishing* (W = 1): Should be reasonably forgiving, you may be out of contention for winning quickly but you should at least be able to play the game to the end.
* *Instinctual -- Calculating* (W = 1): Should be fairly instinctual to ensure turns go quickly.

**Decorum** ([BGG](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/344554/decorum))<br>
Passive aggressive cohabitation is a fantastic and very apt subtitle for this game. Also this is definitely one of my favourite games ever made. See [[decorum|here]]# for my attempts at scenario generation for it.
* *Simple -- Complex*: **10/10**
  * Perfect complexity for a filler game, can easily explain to board gamers. Also a very fun little puzzle.
* *Short -- Long*: **10/10**
  * One game is enough, although could always accidentally fill a night.
* *Chill -- Stressful*: **9/10**
  * Considering it's a cooperative game with a VERY lenient time limit, it's very chill. Some may find it slightly stressful as the 'passive aggressive' parts kick in though.
* *Forgiving -- Punishing*: **10/10**
  * There's essentially no way of completely messing up, since everything can be undone.
* *Instinctual -- Calculating*: **10/10**
  * You quickly realise trying to calculate exactly what your teammates require is futile, so rough instinctual compromise is required.

Final score: **9.8/10**<br><br>

**Sky Team** ([BGG](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/373106/sky-team))<br>
Pilot and co-pilot almost crash a plane for 15 minutes.
* *Simple -- Complex*: **10/10**
  * Perfect complexity for a filler game, can easily explain to board gamers. Also a very fun little puzzle.
* *Short -- Long*: **10/10**
  * One game is enough, although could always accidentally fill a night.
* *Chill -- Stressful*: **4/10**
  * Can be fairly stressful due to the communication limits and constantly being on the verge of failure.
* *Forgiving -- Punishing*: **8/10**
  * You can dig yourselves into a hole, but since it's just a 2 player cooperative game, you both lose together and can simply immediately restart, so still scoring this highly.
* *Instinctual -- Calculating*: **10/10**
  * Nice level of having a rough idea of what you should do, but without complete information can't truly calculate.

Final score: **8.6/10**<br>
Final score if okay with stress: **9.8/10**<br><br>

**No Thanks!** ([BGG](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/12942/no-thanks))<br>
A very unique and interesting trick taking game.
* *Simple -- Complex*: **6/10**
  * Super simple, although potentially too much so, sometimes it feels there isn't enough game there.
* *Short -- Long*: **10/10**
  * Perfect length for a filler game.
* *Chill -- Stressful*: **9/10**
  * I suppose you could stress over the secrecy of your stones or really wanting a card, but otherwise it's chill.
* *Forgiving -- Punishing*: **7/10**
  * You can screw yourself by picking up a high card without enough stones on it, but in usual play it's pretty tight.
* *Instinctual -- Calculating*: **10/10**
  * If you can count to 35 then you're good and everything is instinctual.

Final score: **8.1/10**<br><br>
