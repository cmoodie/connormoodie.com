Here's my ratings of the lightweight games I've played based on the system set out #[[board-games|here]]. Reminder of the ideal property values below:

* *Simple -- Complex* (W = 2): More complex than a party game to make it interesting, but not too intimidating.
* *Luck-based -- Skill-based* (W = 2): Enough luck to give newer players a chance at winning, while still giving agency.
* *Forgiving -- Punishing* (W = 2): Very forgiving, no play a player may make should be really bad, the skills should come in identifying the best in a sea of good.
* *Chill -- Stressful* (W = 2): Should be chill, although some stressful decisions here and there won't hurt.
* *Abstract -- Thematic* (W = 2): Should be fairly thematic to keep new players interested.

**Cat in the Box** ([BGG](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/345972/cat-box-deluxe-edition))<br>
A very unique and interesting trick taking game.
* *Simple -- Complex*: **9/10**
  * Always seems hard to explain, but somehow everyone always picks it up fine. Really fun mechanically as well.
* *Luck-based -- Skill-based*: **9/10**
  * A great mix of luck and skill which means everyone's always in with a shot if they play well.
* *Forgiving -- Punishing*: **10/10**
  * This game is so swingy, you could do horribly until the last round and still win.
* *Chill -- Stressful*: **9/10**
  * Can occasionally be stressful when you REALLY don't want to paradox, which may turn some people away, but it adds a good bit of spice to this game.
* *Abstract -- Thematic*: **7/10**
  * Somewhat thematic, everyone knows Schr√∂dinger's cat and how that relates.

Final score: **8.8/10**<br><br>

**Wandering Towers** ([BGG](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/355483/wandering-towers))<br>
A fantastically funny game of constantly covering other people's wizards.
* *Simple -- Complex*: **10/10**
  * Perfect weight for this type of game, and the simple rules produce really intersting and funny gameplay.
* *Luck-based -- Skill-based*: **8/10**
  * Perhaps a little too luck-dependant sometimes, but otherwise great.
* *Forgiving -- Punishing*: **9/10**
  * The tip "It's easier to fill your potions at the start of the game" is doing a lot of heavy lifting here, but if you are aware of that then you can't really screw yourself over too badly.
* *Chill -- Stressful*: **10/10**
  * Since you know someone will always screw you over by the time you have your next turn, you don't even worry about it.
* *Abstract -- Thematic*: **9/10**
  * Very simply theme but very strong theme, especially helped by the amazing components.

Final score: **9.2/10**<br><br>

**The Quest for El Dorado** ([BGG](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/217372/quest-el-dorado))<br>
Perhaps one of the best deck builders ever made.
* *Simple -- Complex*: **9/10**
  * Only loses a point for constantly having to explain how "two 1-machetes can make you move on a 2-machete space".
* *Luck-based -- Skill-based*: **10/10**
  * Perfect mix.
* *Forgiving -- Punishing*: **6/10**
  * If you build your deck wrong, you can screw yourself over a little bit, but you can always somewhat recover.
* *Chill -- Stressful*: **10/10**
  * No stress, other than really hoping someone doesn't land on a particular spot.
* *Abstract -- Thematic*: **10/10**
  * The theme is really good, really ties the game together as explorers trying to stop eachother from reaching the end first.

Final score: **9.0/10**<br><br>

**Nidavellir** ([BGG](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/293014/nidavellir))<br>
DWERG.
* *Simple -- Complex*: **7/10**
  * Simple game mechanics, although can be a bit repetitive.
* *Luck-based -- Skill-based*: **7/10**
  * A good mix of having a good plan but with the luck of having to guess what other players will do. However, can definitely feel a bit luck dependent at times if you guess wrong too much.
* *Forgiving -- Punishing*: **10/10**
  * You're always in contention to win, since you always get something from each auction.
* *Chill -- Stressful*: **10/10**
  * No stress, other than really hoping you win a particular auction.
* *Abstract -- Thematic*: **4/10**
  * Without DWERG this would be a 1, but DWEEEEEEEEEEEEEERG.

Final score: **7.6/10**<br><br>

**Mysterium** ([BGG](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/181304/mysterium))<br>
A cooperative game that makes the ghost hate you all.
* *Simple -- Complex*: **4/10**
  * This game is an absolute pain in the ass to explain. A 6 if you already know how to play -- game can still be a little dry.
* *Luck-based -- Skill-based*: **8/10**
  * A hilarious mix of luck and skill where everyone's blaming each other, although the luck of what cards you get can be annoying as the ghost.
* *Forgiving -- Punishing*: **10/10**
  * You're always in contention to win as a team.
* *Chill -- Stressful*: **10/10**
  * Even though there's a time limit, the ghost chooses when to flip and and as the investigators you're never stressed.
* *Abstract -- Thematic*: **10/10**
  * Extremely thematic, especially when using the knocks as the ghost.

Final score: **8.4/10**<br><br>
Final score for people who already know how to play: **8.8/10**<br><br>
