Here's my ratings of the party games I've played based on the system set out #[[board-games|here]]. Reminder of the ideal property values below:

* *Simple -- Complex* (W = 4): As simple as possible.
* *Short -- Long* (W = 2): As short as possible.
* *Luck-based -- Skill-based* (W = 2): Quite luck based, but still with some skill involved to ensure players feel that they have agency.
* *Instinctual -- Calculating* (W = 1): Should be fairly instinctual to ensure turns go quickly and players don't feel 'too dumb' for the game.
* *Funny -- Serious* (W = 1): Should be as funny as possible.

**Anomia** ([BGG](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/67877/anomia))<br>
Fantastically funny and social word game that's open to all ages.
* *Simple -- Complex*: **9/10**
  * Very simple, only loses a point due to the wild cards sometimes confusing people rule-wise. 
* *Short -- Long*: **10/10**
  * Very short, and perfect length for people to watch a game then want to join the next without having to really wait.
* *Luck-based -- Skill-based*: **4/10**
  * It's quite skill-based, where if you're bad at it then you will always do poorly, which can drive people away from it.
* *Instinctual -- Calculating*: **10/10**
  * No time to calculate gotTA SAY THE WORD QUICK-
* *Funny -- Serious*: **10/10**
  * The most I've laughed in a board game EVER.

Final score: **8.4/10**<br><br>

**Codenames** ([BGG](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/178900/codenames))<br>
Tense but interesting team-based word game.
* *Simple -- Complex*: **8/10**
  * Once you get it you get it, but the rules can be a bit of a challenge to some. Thankfully can start in a team with other people who know how to play.
* *Short -- Long*: **7/10**
  * Sometimes can go for way too long and lose people's interest as the codemasters take forever to pick a word. Can be solved with a timer, but that can lead to stress and bad 1-word clues.
* *Luck-based -- Skill-based*: **8/10**
  * There's some skill in finding a good clue, but a lot of it is the luck of how your team will interpret it. In a good way, that is.
* *Instinctual -- Calculating*: **2/10**
  * A bit too calculating as people try find the best word. Who knows maybe I should be playing with a timer.
* *Funny -- Serious*: **8/10**
  * It can get pretty funny when some very questionable clues get given, although not all the time.

Final score: **7.2/10**<br><br>

**Wavelength** ([BGG](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/262543/wavelength))<br>
Hilarious team-based opinion game, about being on the same *wavelength* (HA).
* *Simple -- Complex*: **10/10**
  * Extremely simple, anyone can play it.
* *Short -- Long*: **8/10**
  * People can take a while to choose a clue, but it isn't too hard and with two scales to choose from it usually isn't a problem and the game's pretty quick.
* *Luck-based -- Skill-based*: **10/10**
  * Fantastic balance of coming up with good clues while still being at the mercy of your team and the dial.
* *Instinctual -- Calculating*: **6/10**
  * A bit too calculating as people try find the best word, but often people end up giving up and going with their gut anyway.
* *Funny -- Serious*: **9/10**
  * When people think crackers aren't a particularly dry food, things get hilarious fast.

Final score: **9.1/10**<br><br>

**The Mind simple edition** ([BGG](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/244992/mind))<br>
I say simple edition because I usually play it with 6 nimmt cards from 1 - 100, and just ramp up the number of cards each time. No shurikens, no faff, just mind.
* *Simple -- Complex*: **10/10**
  * Extremely simple, anyone can play it.
* *Short -- Long*: **10/10**
  * Rounds are super short so anyone can hop in and out.
* *Luck-based -- Skill-based*: **7/10**
  * It's just luck, potentially a bit too much so though. I mean unless you say a number 30 higher after like 4 seconds have passed FUCKING HEL-
* *Instinctual -- Calculating*: **10/10**
  * Caveat here is that everyone has to agree to not count in their head. If you can all do that, this game is pure gut instinct.
* *Funny -- Serious*: **8/10**
  * Can be somewhat funny when people fuck up.

Final score: **9.2/10**<br><br>

**The Fuzzies** ([BGG](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/314421/fuzzies))<br>
Jenga but with fuzzballs.
* *Simple -- Complex*: **10/10**
  * Extremely simple, anyone can play it.
* *Short -- Long*: **7/10**
  * Easy to hop in and out, even mid round if people wanted to. Super flexible. However docking some points as it can take a while to get back to your turn.
* *Luck-based -- Skill-based*: **10/10**
  * It's like Jenga, good combination of the skill of not knocking it over, with the luck of you never really know which part of the tower is crucial.
* *Instinctual -- Calculating*: **10/10**
  * You can't calculate which fuzzball to pick, pure instinct.
* *Funny -- Serious*: **4/10**
  * The cards make it funny which is why I prefer it to Jenga, but can get stale.

Final score: **8.8/10**<br><br>
