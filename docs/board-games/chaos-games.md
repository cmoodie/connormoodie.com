# Chaos Games

Here's my ratings of the chaos games I've played based on the system set out #[[board-games|here]]. Reminder of the ideal property values below:

* *Funny -- Serious* (W = 3): Should be very funny, pretty much the point of the game.
* *Luck-based -- Skill-based* (W = 3): Pretty much entirely luck-based, so you just feel unlucky when things go wrong as opposed to annoyed at yourself.
* *Short -- Long* (W = 2): Fairly short, want to be able to reset often.
* *Forgiving -- Punishing* (W = 2): Should be quite punishing, more funny when things go wrong for them to go REALLY wrong.

**Survive: Escape from Atlantis!** ([BGG](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2653/survive-escape-atlantis))<br>
Brilliantly funny game about punishing others' greed as they put all 3 of their people on one boat.
* *Funny -- Serious*: **8/10**
  * Very funny as people fly off the board, although can rub some people the wrong way.
* *Luck-based -- Skill-based*: **10/10**
  * VERY luck based, your plans can be ruined at the roll of someone else's dice.
* *Short -- Long*: **7/10**
  * A tad too long, you can know very well you've lost and the game just keeps going.
* *Forgiving -- Punishing*: **10/10**
  * Things can go hilariously very wrong for you in this game.

Final score: **8.8/10**<br><br>
