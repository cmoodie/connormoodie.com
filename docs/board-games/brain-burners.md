Here are my reviews of the brain-burners I've played based on the system set out #[[board-games|here]]:

## Owned
**The Search for Planet X** ([BGG](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/279537/search-planet-x))<br>
A massive logic puzzle that everyone seems to enjoy, even those not into logic puzzles usually.
* **Brain-burner:** 


* *Simple -- Complex*: **7/10**
  * A good puzzle, but gameplay can get stale after a few plays.
* *Instinctual -- Calculating*: **10/10**
  * This game is pure calculation, and rewards it well.
* *Luck-based -- Skill-based*: **9/10**
  * Pretty much entirely skill based, but can be a little luck based with lucky surveys or targets.
* *Solitary -- Interactive*: **10/10**
  * If you want you can treat it as a solo game, but can always choose to incorporate others' actions.

Final score: **8.8/10**<br><br>

**The Search for Lost Species** ([BGG](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/279537/search-planet-x))<br>
An even more complex massive logic puzzle that players of Planet X enjoy even more.
* *Simple -- Complex*: **10/10**
  * Incredible puzzle, although disclaimer I've only played it once.
* *Instinctual -- Calculating*: **10/10**
  * This game is pure calculation, and rewards it well.
* *Luck-based -- Skill-based*: **9/10**
  * Pretty much entirely skill based, but can be a little luck based with lucky surveys or targets.
* *Solitary -- Interactive*: **10/10**
  * If you want you can treat it as a solo game, but can always choose to incorporate others' actions.

Final score: **9.7/10**<br><br>

**Brass Birmingham** ([BGG](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/224517/brass-birmingham))<br>
Number 1 on BGG for a reason.
* *Simple -- Complex*: **10/10**
  * I will never fully understand this game but I will constantly enjoy trying to.
* *Instinctual -- Calculating*: **10/10**
  * So much long-term planning in this game, but all of it is fun.
* *Luck-based -- Skill-based*: **10/10**
  * I suppose there's slight luck by what other people do and the cards you draw, but that just makes the calculations more interesting and its still a 10 here for me.
* *Solitary -- Interactive*: **8/10**
  * Can sometimes have turns take a while due to changing circumstances, but usually you can know roughly what your plan for your next turn is before it comes around.

Final score: **9.8/10**<br><br>

**The Crew: The Quest for Planet Nine** ([BGG](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/284083/crew-quest-planet-nine))<br>
Making you and your team feel amazingly smart when you succeed.
* *Simple -- Complex*: **8/10**
  * Such complexity arising from such simple rules it's fantastic, although can be a little too simple occasionally.
* *Instinctual -- Calculating*: **8/10**
  * Counting cards makes this game really interesting, but sometimes you just have to go with your gut.
* *Luck-based -- Skill-based*: **8/10**
  * Sometimes you get a dud round where you either easily win or lose, but usually you win or lose based on the skill of your team.
* *Solitary -- Interactive*: **10/10**
  * As a cooperative game, what your teammates do *is* the puzzle.

Final score: **8.2/10**<br><br>

**The Crew: Mission Deep Sea** ([BGG](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/324856/crew-mission-deep-sea))<br>
Making you and your team feel somewhat smart but also somewhat lucky when you succeed.
* *Simple -- Complex*: **8/10**
  * Such complexity arising from such simple rules it's fantastic, although can be a little too simple occasionally.
* *Instinctual -- Calculating*: **8/10**
  * Counting cards makes this game really interesting, but sometimes you just have to go with your gut.
* *Luck-based -- Skill-based*: **4/10**
  * Far more often than the original you get a dud round where you either easily win or lose.
* *Solitary -- Interactive*: **10/10**
  * As a cooperative game, what your teammates do *is* the puzzle.

Final score: **7.0/10**<br><br>

**Turing Machine** ([BGG](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/356123/turing-machine))<br>
Very neat artifact that kinda plays okay as a game.
* *Simple -- Complex*: **1/10**
  * Bursts of complexity surrounded by somewhat mind-numbing process of elimination, and an EXTREMELY mind-numbing process of setting the whole thing up each time.
* *Instinctual -- Calculating*: **10/10**
  * Pure calculation.
* *Luck-based -- Skill-based*: **9/10**
  * Can sometimes get lucky, but otherwise completely skill based.
* *Solitary -- Interactive*: **10/10**
  * Purely solitary so can calculate completely.

Final score: **7.0/10**<br><br>

## Unowned
**Spirit Island** ([BGG](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/162886/spirit-island))<br>
Easily the best cooperative brain-burner out there.
* *Simple -- Complex*: **10/10**
  * The entire game is a crazy interesting puzzle.
* *Instinctual -- Calculating*: **10/10**
  * Pretty much pure calculation, finding the best move involves a great amount of skill and experience.
* *Luck-based -- Skill-based*: **9/10**
  * Can sometimes get lucky, but otherwise completely skill based.
* *Solitary -- Interactive*: **10/10**
  * Teammates don't hinder your plans, instead they HELP them and make things even more interesting.

Final score: **9.7/10**<br><br>
