# Poirot Reviews
While I still prefer physical books, my [Kobo](https://au.kobobooks.com/products/kobo-clara-2e) has been fantastic for travel. Through it I've discovered a love for Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot series, the way she writes how the "funny little man" expertly solves the cases is absolutely genius. I've decided to keep track of my thoughts on each entry in the series using the following rating system:

* 5/5: A must-read for anyone.
* 4/5: A must-read for those who like Poirot.
* 3/5: Good read for those who want more Poirot.
* 2/5: Could fairly easily give it a miss.
* 1/5: Actively bad, don't waste your time.
* 0/5: Offensively bad, you'll be worse off after reading it.

**\#01 [5/5] <br> The Mysterious Affair at Styles**<br>
Fantastic entry point to the series, loved it.

**\#02 [2/5] <br> The Murder on the Links**<br>
I don't know, just didn't really feel this one, hardly memorable.

**\#04 [3/5] <br> The Murder of Roger Ackroyd**<br>
Vaguely remember this one being decent (starting these reviews well after reading this).

**\#06 [3/5] <br> The Mystery of the Blue Train**<br>
Decent but nothing amazing.

**\#08 [5/5] <br> Peril at End House**<br>
Really enjoyed the deep insights into Poirot's thought processes and notes in this one.

**\#10 [4/5] <br> Murder on the Orient Express**<br>
Very good, but not quite up to par with the 5/5s.

**\#14 [4/5] <br> Murder in Mesopotamia**<br>
Very enjoyable writing style, case was good too.

**\#18 [5/5] <br> Death on the Nile**<br>
Absolutely Fantastic.
