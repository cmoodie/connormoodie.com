Parts used for ratios, but I'll generally make 1 part = 1 shot. A (rest) indicates that generally you just fill the rest of the glass with it.

##### [Lynchburg Lemonade]
Recipe incoming once made myself.

##### [Lemon Lime & Bitters]
I don't care if you think this is too much bitters is weak without it.
* 15-20 drops of bitters
* 3/4 parts lime juice
* 7 (rest) parts lemonade
