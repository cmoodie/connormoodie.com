Parts used for ratios, but I'll generally make 1 part = 1 shot. "Drops" is accurate where 1 part = 1 shot. A (rest) indicates that generally you just fill the rest of the glass with it.

##### Lynchburg Lemonade
Nice way to make whiskey/bourban refreshing.
* 10 drops bitters
* 1/2 parts lime juice
* 1 part triple sec
* 3/2 parts whiskey
* 5 (rest) parts lemonade

##### Lemon Lime & Bitters
I don't care if you think this is too much bitters is weak without it.
* 15-20 drops of bitters
* 3/4 parts lime juice
* 7 (rest) parts lemonade
